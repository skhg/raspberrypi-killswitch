# Raspberry Pi kill switch

This is a project to create a [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram) [kill switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch) for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (Specifically the [Model 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)).

## Background

I used a Raspberry Pi along with [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) to play music wirelessly in my living room. However, sometimes I want to turn off the music in a hurry, and I don't know which device (phone, laptop, my wife's phone, etc) is streaming sound to the speaker. This led to the idea of a physical switch connected to the Raspberry Pi which would kill the music immediately.
