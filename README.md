# Raspberry Pi kill switch

This is a project to create a [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram) [kill switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch) for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (Specifically the [Model 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)). It's got a 3-colour LED included to give some status information as it does its job.

## Background

I used a Raspberry Pi along with [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) to play music wirelessly in my living room. However, sometimes I want to turn off the music in a hurry, and I don't know which device (phone, laptop, my wife's phone, etc) is streaming sound to the speaker. This led to the idea of a physical switch connected to the Raspberry Pi which would kill the music immediately.

## The finished product

## Materials required
* Raspberry Pi Model 3
* A button
* A cap from a moisturiser jar
* A 3-colour LED module
* Some ribbon cable
* A 200â„¦ resistor
* Soldering iron
* Small circuit board and connectors

## Assembly Instructions
I started by drilling through the moisturiser jar cap, to have somewhere to mount the button. I previously used one of these for my [water level indicator](https://github.com/skhg/water-filter-sensor) so it was another chance to have a nice plain mount for something. Underneath, i mounted the LED module and soldered the wires to the button terminals. In all, 6 wires are required for the button and the LED module.

The LED module has some built-in resistors so it can be hooked up to a normal 3.3V GPIO pin without any other components required. But the button needs a resistor to ensure we don't blow the circuit if it was pressed too long or shorted. So the next step was to assemble a mini board that will mount on to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

Once this was put together, it was as easy as connecting the ribbon cable up, and plugging in the power. Here it's installed and everything else tidied away:
